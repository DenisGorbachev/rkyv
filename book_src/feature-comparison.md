# Feature Comparison

This is a best-effort feature comparison between rkyv, FlatBuffers, and Cap'n Proto. This is by no
means completely comprehensive, and pull requests that improve this are welcomed.

\* *rkyv's open type system allows extension types that provide these capabilities*

## Open type system

One of rkyv's primary features is that its type system is *open*. This means that users can write
custom types and control their properties very finely. You can think of rkyv as a solid foundation
to build many other features on top of. In fact, the open type system is already a fundamental part
of how rkyv works.

### Unsized types

Even though they're part of the main library, unsized types are built on top of the core
serialization functionality. Types like `Box` and `Rc/Arc` that can hold unsized types are entry
points for unsized types into the sized system.

### Trait objects

Trait objects are further built on top of unsized types to make serializing and using trait objects
easy and safe.
